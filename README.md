# Point Partitioning ALgorithm

An efficient Greedy Algorith to approximate best lines for point partitioning using axis parallel lines

use 

 ` 
 ./gradlew runGreedy for a normal greedy solution
 
  ` 
use 

 ` 
 ./gradlew runEfficient for an advanced greedy solution
 ` 
use 

 ` 
 ./gradlew graph to generate graphs for each solution instance
